This design choice was carefully evaluated using Lotus software to determine the ideal camber and caster angles. The suspension was then tested in ANSYS to ensure it could withstand the forces encountered during operation without bending or making contact with other components.

Finally, we used wheels from Splendor Bike for the front wheels, providing better weight distribution and pre-installed drum brakes. For the rear wheel, we chose an R28-1.5-inch wheel after facing availability and cost challenges. The braking system is custom-designed, featuring a combi brake setup that evenly distributes braking forces across the front wheels, ensuring safety and stability.

To resolve this, we custom-designed a robust power shaft made of mild steel with a 35 mm radius. This modification eliminated the bending issue, ensuring smooth power delivery from the motor to the wheels. The system incorporates six gears and two power shafts, enabling the vehicle to switch between manual pedaling and electric power seamlessly.

The suspension system, including wishbones and fork suspension, was also custom-built in the IIT Mandi workshop, ensuring a perfect fit for the vehicle’s requirements. The most complex part was manufacturing the Ackermann steering, which required precise cutting and assembly to ensure accurate steering geometry.
